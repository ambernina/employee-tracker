# employee-tracker

## Description
This is an engineering team generator command line application. It prompts the user for information about their team. The user can add any number of employees and they can be either managers, engineers, or interns. The application also has built in tests so that the user can check if everything is functioning before running the app. When the user is finished adding employees the app generates an HTML page that displays all the information that the user added for their employees.

## Description 

This project was created to generate an employee tracker using a CLI and mySQL. Data is gathered into three tables based on department,
role, and employee. The data can then be displayed in the console. The employee role can be updated.

This application can further be updated to delete departments, roles, and employees. In addition, functionality can be added to 
update employee managers and view employees by manager.
